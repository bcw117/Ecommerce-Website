## Fake Store Website 
A dummy e-commerce website was created using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js (MERN stack). Implemented Stripe for user payments and deployed using Vercel. The product data used was taken from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), and JWT authentication was implemented using Bearer tokens.
